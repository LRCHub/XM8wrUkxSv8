Why are you such a Fake! Fake!
Fake!
Thought you had me 'round your
finger
Now my phones off the receiver
Apparently you don't know or do
care to
Comprehend just what I'm saying
You made me worship you from
head to toe
You're flaky with my heart so
now I'm leavin'
(I'm leavin')
You really had me going baby
Come on! Give me a break!
You really had me going baby
How come you're such a Fake
Fake! Fake! Fake!
Why are you such a Fake! Fake!
Fake!
Yeah ya took me high you made my
Heart go 'round and 'round you
gave me fever
But lately I've been seekin'
deeper meanings
And vibrations with another
You really had me going baby
Come on! Give me a break!
You really had me going baby
How come you're such a Fake
Fake! Fake! Fake!
Why you such a Fake! Fake! Fake!
Why you such a Fake! Fake! Fake!
Thought you had me 'round your
finger
Now my phones off the receiver
Fake! Fake! Fake!
Why you such a Fake! Fake! Fake!
Why you such a Fake! Fake! Fake!
Thought you had me 'round your
finger
Now my phones off the receiver
Why you such a
Fake! Fake! Fake!
